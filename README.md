## Interview question:

This repository contains a python program called data_gen.  Execute it and it
will produce a file called "data.txt" with two columns.  The first column is a
time stamp in seconds.  The second column is a quanity called SNR.  The data is
1000 seconds in duration and evenly sampled at 1000 samples per second.  It is
time ordered.  Calculate the max SNR over 1 second data blocks recording both
the timestamp and SNR at each max value for each second.  Create a figure to
visualize this data.  Create a webpage to present your findings.
